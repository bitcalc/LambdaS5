Test262
=======

As the official Test262 keeps adding new tests, we have compressed a tar file which
contains a snapshot of test262 and the test harness that are used in the Onward!
paper (Slimming Languages by Reducing Sugar).

To get test262 test suite, type:

$ tar xf test262.tar.gz

Then all js tests can be found at <LambdaS5-path>/tests/test262/test262/test/suite/.

All tests in the snapshot are modified to add `esid` in js comments. The esid is for
analyzing testing result.

There are two suites in the tar file:
 - LambdaS5/tests/test262/test262/test/suite: modified to exclude eval and Function
 - LambdaS5/tests/test262/test262/test/suite.orig: the original suite with esid added.
