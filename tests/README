Test262
=======

As the official Test262 adds new tests now and then. We compressed a tar file
which contains the snapshot of test262 and the test harness used in the paper.

To get test262 used for S5, type:

$ tar xf test262.tar.gz

All js tests can be found at LambdaS5/tests/test262/test262/test/suite/.

All tests in the test suite are modified to add esid in comments. The esid is
for analyzing testing result.

There are two suites in the tar file:
 - LambdaS5/tests/test262/test262/test/suite: modified to exclude eval and Function
 - LambdaS5/tests/test262/test262/test/suite.orig: the original suite with esid added.
